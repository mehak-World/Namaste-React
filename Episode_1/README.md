React at the end of the day is simple Javascript code.
First way to include React into your project is using the cdn links
CDN stands for Content Delivery Network.

There are two cdn links for including react into your project - React and React-DOM

Basic Syntax of writing React code is as follows:

React.createElement("h1", {}, "This is a heading tag") -> Write the name of the tag you want to create, the second object allows to give attributes to your tags like {id: "heading"}

In the third argumnet, we can only pass one child or an array of children.

If there is a large nested structure, it will be very difficult to code it using createElement. So, there is a need for JSX

JSX stands for Javascript XML
